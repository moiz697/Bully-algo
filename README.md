# Fault-Tolerant Distributed System

This Python code implements a fault-tolerant distributed system using the multiprocessing module. The system allows multiple processors to communicate, elect a leader, and maintain system integrity even if some processors fail.

## Classes and Functions

### Processor Class

- Represents a processor in the distributed system.
- Attributes:
    - `processor_id`: Unique identifier for each processor.
    - `priority`: Priority level of the processor, used in leader election.
    - `leader`: Identifier of the current leader processor.
    - `backup_leader`: Identifier of the backup leader processor.
    - `processors`: Dictionary storing information about other processors in the system.
    - `failed`: Flag indicating whether the processor has failed.
    - `heartbeat_interval`: Time interval between sending heartbeat signals.
    - `missed_heartbeats`: Counter to track missed heartbeat signals.
    - `heartbeat_timeout`: Maximum time allowed between heartbeats before considering a processor failed.
    - `acknowledged`: Shared flag for acknowledgment.
    - `lock`: Multiprocessing lock for ensuring process safety.
- Methods:
    - `send_heartbeat()`
    - `start_heartbeat()`
    - `stop_heartbeat()`
    - `detect_failure()`
    - `initiate_election()`
    - `send_election_message()`
    - `respond_to_election()`
    - `broadcast_leader()`
    - `update_leader()`
    - `join_network()`
    - `recover_processor()`
    - `leave_network()`
    - `update_configuration()`
    - `recover_network()`

### Main Function

- Initializes multiple processors in the network.
- Starts the heartbeat process for each processor.
- Initiates leader election among processors.
- Updates the configuration of a specific processor.
- Simulates a processor leaving the network.
- Handles exceptions that may occur during execution.

## Usage

1. **Initialization:**
    - Create instances of the Processor class with unique IDs and priorities.
    - Add processors to the `processors` dictionary.

2. **Heartbeat Process:**
    - Call `start_heartbeat()` for each processor.

3. **Leader Election:**
    - Call `initiate_election()` for each processor.

4. **Configuration Update:**
    - Call `update_configuration()` to update parameters.

5. **Processor Removal:**
    - Call `leave_network()` to remove a processor.

6. **Error Handling:**
    - Use try-except blocks for error handling.

## Conclusion

This code provides a framework for building fault-tolerant distributed systems. It enables communication, leader election, and fault recovery in a distributed environment.
